Ride share project for APCS

The project has a car, passengers, and a station. The stations have a list of passengers on a certain station and the cars try to pick up the passengers and move them around. The passengers have a certain destination and cars try to get the passengers to their destination. 

The results were that the passengers were sometimes moved to the correct area and sometimes not. It's difficult to get all the cars moving to the right place with passengers and often mixups or left out passegengers will occur. However, succeses were the majority of results with usually around 60-80% of Passengers getting to their destination. 

I like the car and road classes made because they have all the heavy lifting of the project, thus having it completed feels the best.
